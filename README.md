# Analysis & Visualization of CO₂ Emissions

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the change in carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across different regions, subcontinents, and countries over time. The analysis includes:
- Regional, subcontinental, and global CO₂ emission trends.
- The top continents and countries with the highest and lowest CO₂ emission growth.
- Yearly emission comparisons for **China, Russia, and the United States** using subplots.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, filtering relevant records.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends and patterns in CO₂ emissions.
- **Visualizations:** Line plots, bar charts, and customized graphs with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Yearly Comparison:** A dedicated subplot visualization for three major emitting countries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing yearly CO₂ emission changes. The dataset is preprocessed to filter data for continents, countries, and subcontinents.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
